### Chart Quality Checklist

- [ ] Finding-based title (states the insight, not just the data)
- [ ] Labeled axes with units
- [ ] Colorblind-safe palette (viridis, cividis, or Seaborn colorblind)
- [ ] No chart junk (unnecessary gridlines, 3D effects, decorative elements)
- [ ] Annotations on key data points if applicable
- [ ] Saved with `fig.savefig('chart.png', dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight')`

## Peer Review

Review **two** open PRs from other learners. For each, leave a review comment with:

1. **One thing the chart does well** — be specific (e.g., "the sorted horizontal bars make the comparison easy to read")
2. **One improvement suggestion** — reference the chart type framework, Gestalt principles, or annotation practices from the Module 4 reading (e.g., "consider adding value labels at the end of each bar so exact numbers are visible without hovering")
